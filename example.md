# Some Example Math

Surely, math works...

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mu &= \sum_{t=0}^{-N} \tau_t S_t \exp\left(\beta^0 + \beta^1 p_t\right)\\
&= \exp \left(\beta^0\right) \sum_t \tau_t S_t \exp\left(\beta^1 p_t\right)
\end{aligned}
$$


Oh, and here's some code

```python
import numpy as np

np.array([x**2 for x in range(10)])
```
